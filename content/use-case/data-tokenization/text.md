## Introduction to Data Tokenization

**Data tokenization** is a powerful security technique that replaces sensitive information with unique identification symbols, or tokens. This method is crucial for protecting various types of sensitive data, including:

- Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Know Your Customer (KYC) data
- Payment Card Industry (PCI) data

By tokenizing these different types of data, organizations can significantly enhance their data protection strategies, reduce the risk of data breaches, and simplify compliance with various regulations.

## The Importance of Secure Data Storage

Secure storage of sensitive data is critical for several reasons:

1. **Regulatory Compliance:** Various regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) require robust data protection measures.
2. **Breach Prevention:** Secure storage minimizes the risk and impact of potential data breaches.
3. **Customer Trust:** Protecting sensitive data builds and maintains trust with customers and partners.
4. **Risk Mitigation:** Proper data protection reduces financial and reputational risks associated with data breaches.

## Databunker: A Comprehensive Solution for Data Tokenization and Secure Storage

Databunker is an innovative open-source project that provides a unified solution for tokenizing and securely storing various types of sensitive data. Whether you're dealing with PII, PHI, KYC, or PCI data, Databunker offers robust protection and management capabilities.

Key Features of Databunker:

- **Versatile Data Protection:** Capable of handling PII, PHI, KYC, and PCI data within a single system.
- **Comprehensive Tokenization:** Tokenizes entire data objects rather than individual fields.
- **Strong Encryption:** Ensures all stored information is encrypted.
- **Secure Indexing:** Utilizes hash-based indexing for all search operations.
- **API-Based Access:** Provides secure, controlled access to data through API calls.
- **Compliance-Ready:** Designed with various regulatory requirements in mind.

## How Databunker Works

1. **Data Ingestion:** When sensitive data is submitted, Databunker tokenizes the entire record.
2. **Token Generation:** A unique UUID is generated for each record, serving as a secure reference.
3. **Secure Storage:** The original data is encrypted and stored securely within Databunker.
4. **Token Usage:** The generated UUID can be safely used in databases, logs, or other systems.
5. **Data Retrieval:** Authorized systems can retrieve the original data using the UUID or other search parameters.

## Getting Started with Databunker

### Launching Databunker in Development Mode

To start Databunker for testing and development:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --rm --name databunker securitybunker/databunker demo
```

This command starts a local Databunker instance with a `DEMO` root access key.

### Storing and Retrieving Sensitive Data

#### Storing Data (Example with PII)

```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/v1/user -X POST -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first":"John","last":"Doe","login":"john","phone":"4444","email":"user@gmail.com"}'
```

This call returns a UUID token for the stored record.

#### Retrieving Data

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET \
  http://localhost:3000/v1/user/token/f8a1b0d2-5e47-11ef-a729-32e05c6f6c16
```

Databunker supports retrieval by token, email, phone, or custom identifiers.
