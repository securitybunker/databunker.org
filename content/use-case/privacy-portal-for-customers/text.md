Databunker is a powerful encrypted vault specially designed for developers to protect sensitive records, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Health Information (PHI), Know Your Customer (KYC) records, and Payment Card Industry (PCI) data.

When a user record is created, Databunker extracts the user's email, phone number, and login name, and builds a secure hash-based search index.

To ensure compliance with regulations like the GDPR, Databunker provides a user interface that enables customers to access and review their personal data, as well as request modifications.

Databunker provides customers with a convenient passwordless access feature through the Databunker user privacy portal. When customers try to log in, they are securely issued a one-time access code via SMS or email. This eliminates the need for passwords and enhances the overall user experience while maintaining strong security measures.

Upon entering the access code, customers gain temporary access to view their data, initiate requests for personal information changes (data rectification requests), initiate the forget-me operation, manage privacy agreements, and review audit events.

Depending on the configuration, Databunker sends a notification email to the Data Privacy Officer (DPO) to approve or reject user requests. For instance, DPOs can approve or reject forget-me requests from users.
