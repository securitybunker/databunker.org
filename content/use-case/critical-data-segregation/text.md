In today's digital landscape, ensuring online privacy and data protection has become a top priority for businesses worldwide, driven by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If your company serves European customers, **GDPR compliance is non-negotiable, irrespective of your location**. 

This article explores **critical data segregation** and demonstrates how open-source [Databunker](https://databunker.org/doc/start/) can protect corporate secrets and maintain GDPR compliance.

## What is data segregation?
**Data segregation** is the practice of separating sensitive or critical data from other less sensitive data within a system or organization. The goal is to enhance security and minimize the risk of unauthorized access or compromise of the critical information.

### Key Aspects of Critical Data Segregation:

1. **Data Classification:** Understanding data sensitivity levels is crucial for devising an effective data segregation strategy.
1. **Separation of Data:** Logically or physically segregating critical data ensures tight access control and prevents unintended exposure.
1. **Access Controls:** Stringent access controls limit interactions with critical data to authorized personnel, reducing potential security breaches.
1. **Encryption:** Implementing robust encryption adds an extra layer of protection, safeguarding critical data even in the face of unauthorized access attempts.
1. **Monitoring and Auditing:** Consistent data access monitoring and audits detect anomalies, ensuring compliance with security policies.
1. **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Establishing reliable data backups and disaster recovery plans mitigate risks and ensure business continuity.
1. **Compliance and Regulations:** Critical data segregation is pivotal in meeting GDPR requirements, especially for organizations with European customers.

### Applying Critical Data Segregation with Databunker:
**Databunker**, an open-source project, offers an all-in-one solution to implement **critical data segregation** for your organization. [Databunker](https://databunker.org/) can be used to store your customer personal records in secure and compliant way. It can be used to store:
* **Personally Identifiable Information** (**PII**)
* **Personal Health Information** (**PHI**)
* **Know Your Customer** (**KYC**) records
* **Payment Card Industry** (**PCI**) data

### Compliance Made Simple:
After performing **data classification (1)** you can **separate personal data (2)** and store it in Databunker. Deploying Databunker effectively minimizes the impact of an attack on your existing database, thereby minimizing risks to your business.

Databunker can help you with **access controls (3)**, **encryption (4)**, **auditing (5)**, and **compliance (7)**. You can easily implement the **backup and disaster recovery (6)** procedure - you can backup the encrypted database used by Databunker (MySQL, PostgreSQL, RDS, Aurora, etc...).

### Safe Data Handling in Breach Situations:
In case of a web app breach, customer personal data remains safe within Databunker, isolated from the main database. This isolation prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information, safeguarding user privacy.
