In today's digital landscape, ensuring online privacy and data protection has become a top priority for businesses worldwide, driven by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If your company serves European customers, **GDPR compliance is non-negotiable, irrespective of your location**. 

This article delves into the concept of **critical data segregation** and demonstrates how open-source Databunker can protect corporate secrets and maintain GDPR compliance.

## What is critical data segregation?
**Critical data segregation** is the practice of separating sensitive or critical data from other less sensitive data within a system or organization. The goal is to enhance security and minimize the risk of unauthorized access or compromise of the critical information.

### Key points on critical data segregation:
1. **Data Classification**: Thoroughly understanding the varying levels of data sensitivity is crucial for devising an effective data segregation strategy.
1. **Separation of Data**: By logically or physically segregating critical data from other datasets, organizations can tightly control access and prevent unintended exposure.
1. **Access Controls**: Implementing stringent access controls ensures that only authorized individuals can interact with critical data, significantly reducing potential security breaches.
1. **Encryption**: Employing robust encryption techniques provides an additional layer of protection for critical data, even if unauthorized access occurs.
1. **Monitoring and Auditing**: Consistent monitoring of data access and conducting audits help detect any anomalies, enabling compliance with security policies.
1. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Establishing reliable data backups and disaster recovery plans is essential to mitigate risks and ensure seamless business continuity.
1. **Compliance and Regulations**: Critical data segregation plays a vital role in meeting GDPR requirements, especially for organizations with European customers.

## How it is applied to Databunker?
Databunker is an open-source project that provides a one-stop-shop solution to implement **critical data segregation** for your organization. Databunker can be used to store your customer personal records in secure and compliant way. It can be used to store:
* **Personally Identifiable Information** (**PII**)
* **Personal Health Information** (**PHI**)
* **Know Your Customer** (**KYC**) records
* **Payment Card Industry** (**PCI**) data

By storing customer personal data in the Databunker, you are effectively minimizing the impact of an attack from your existing database, thereby minimizing business risk factors.

In the event of a bad actor exploiting an **SQL injection** in your web app, the personal data of your customers remains safe since it is stored separately from your existing database, residing within Databunker.

Furthermore, Databunker facilitates storing additional user information independently from personal profiles, such as shipping information. With Databunker's API, you can retrieve this extra data without exposing user personal records, enhancing data privacy and security.
