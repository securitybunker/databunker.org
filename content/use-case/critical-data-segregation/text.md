In today's digital landscape, ensuring online privacy and data protection has become a top priority for businesses worldwide, driven by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If your company serves European customers, **GDPR compliance is non-negotiable, irrespective of your location**. 

This article explores **critical data segregation** and demonstrates how open-source Databunker can protect corporate secrets and maintain GDPR compliance.

## What is critical data segregation?
**Critical data segregation** is the practice of separating sensitive or critical data from other less sensitive data within a system or organization. The goal is to enhance security and minimize the risk of unauthorized access or compromise of the critical information.

### Key points on critical data segregation:
1. **Data Classification**: Thoroughly understanding the varying levels of data sensitivity is crucial for devising an effective data segregation strategy.
1. **Separation of Data**: By logically or physically segregating critical data from other datasets, organizations can tightly control access and prevent unintended exposure.
1. **Access Controls**: Implementing stringent access controls ensures that only authorized individuals can interact with critical data, significantly reducing potential security breaches.
1. **Encryption**: Employing robust encryption techniques provides an additional layer of protection for critical data, even if unauthorized access occurs.
1. **Monitoring and Auditing**: Consistent monitoring of data access and conducting audits help detect any anomalies, enabling compliance with security policies.
1. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Establishing reliable data backups and disaster recovery plans is essential to mitigate risks and ensure seamless business continuity.
1. **Compliance and Regulations**: Critical data segregation plays a vital role in meeting GDPR requirements, especially for organizations with European customers.

## How it is applied to Databunker?
**Databunker**, an open-source project, offers an all-in-one solution to implement **critical data segregation** for your organization. [Databunker](https://databunker.org/) can be used to store your customer personal records in secure and compliant way. It can be used to store:
* **Personally Identifiable Information** (**PII**)
* **Personal Health Information** (**PHI**)
* **Know Your Customer** (**KYC**) records
* **Payment Card Industry** (**PCI**) data

After performing **data classification (1)** you can **separate personal data (2)** and store it in Databunker. Deploying Databunker effectively minimizes the impact of an attack on your existing database, thereby minimizing risks to your business.

Databunker can help you with **access controls (3)**, **encryption (4)**, **auditing (5)**, and **compliance (7)**. You can easily implement the **backup and disaster recovery (6)** procedure - you can backup the encrypted database used by Databunker (MySQL, PostgreSQL, RDS, Aurora, etc...).

In case of a web app breach, customer personal data remains safe within Databunker, independently stored from your existing database.
