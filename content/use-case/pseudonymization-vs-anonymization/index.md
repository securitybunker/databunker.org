According to **GDPR Article 32**:
>The controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk including the **pseudonymization** and **encryption** of personal data.

GDPR defines pseudonymization as:
>‘pseudonymization’ means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept **separately** and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

Databunker meets the definition of pseudonymization by encrypting and storing user personal data separately from the application database. When a user object is saved in Databunker, a **random user token** is generated, serving as a **pseudonymized user identity**.

To comply with **cross-border transfers** or when **saving application logs**, it is recommended to replace user identities (such as email or name) with the user token generated by Databunker. This ensures that the user is **not directly identifiable**, and this approach is [compatible with Schrems II](https://databunker.org/use-case/schrems-ii-compliance/), addressing the requirements for data transfers outside the European Economic Area (EEA).
