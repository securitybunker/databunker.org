In today's digital age, personal data has become one of the most valuable commodities, with businesses relying on it to provide tailored services and products to their customers. However, this also means that the protection of personal information is of paramount importance to ensure both user privacy and regulatory compliance. Personal Identifiable Information (PII) stands at the core of this concern, representing data that can be used to identify an individual directly or indirectly.

### What is PII Data?
PII data encompasses any information that can be used to identify an individual, either on its own or when combined with other available data. This can include a wide range of information, from obvious identifiers like full names, social security numbers, and email addresses, to less apparent details like IP addresses, geolocation data, and even biometric data. Essentially, any piece of information that could be used to trace back to an individual falls under the umbrella of PII.

### Examples of PII:
* Full Name
* Social Security Number
* Date of Birth
* Phone Number
* Email Address
* Physical Address
* Driver's License Number
* Passport Number
* Financial Information (Bank Account, Credit Card Details)
* IP Address
* Biometric Data (Fingerprint, Retina Scan)
