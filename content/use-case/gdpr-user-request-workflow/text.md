In the realm of data protection, complying with GDPR regulations often requires a customized approach to user requests. Open-source Databunker offers a solution to handle user request approvals seamlessly.

### Streamlining User Requests:
Databunker supports various customer operations, such as personal record changes (e.g., name, email), application information updates, consent withdrawal, and forget-me requests. These operations can be automatically executed in the Databunker database, or an Admin/DPO request can be generated for approval.

### Enhancing User Request Management:
For larger organizations, DPOs can efficiently approve user requests through the Databunker platform. The flexibility to configure self-service and Admin/DPO-approved operations empowers organizations to cater to specific needs while ensuring GDPR compliance.
