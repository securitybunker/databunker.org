If you are a software developer or a software architect, **Databunker** is a perfect tool for you. Databunker is used as a **secure and encrypted vault** for customer data. The product comes with a simple web user interface to manage the data stored.

One of the product's key features is that **users can control the data stored in Databunker**. This control is managed by your company policy. You can specify what operations need approval. For example, address change can be confirmed by an Admin or DPO.

Databunker gives your customers **passwordless access** to the **Databunker User Privacy Portal**. Upon login attempt, **Databunker** sends your customer a **one-time access code**. This code is sent by SMS or email.
