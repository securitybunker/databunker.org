⚠️ Here is a simple truth: <b>traditional database encryption often provides a false sense of security</b>.

What are the risks of traditional database security solutions?

* **Data encryption is not enough:** Most cloud and security vendors provide only data or disk encryption
* **Unfiltered GraphQL Queries:** Attackers can retrieve unencrypted data via incorrectly filtered queries
* **SQL Injection Attacks:** Cybercriminals can easily access plain text data through SQL injection

#### Introducing Databunker

Databunker is a specialized system for secure storage, data tokenization, and consent management, designed to protect:
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* Protected Health Information (PHI)
* Payment Card Industry (PCI) data
* Know Your Customer (KYC) records

## Accelerated compliance without custom coding
Deploying Databunker in your organization simplifies compliance by addressing most security RFPs and certification questionnaires (e.g., SOC2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, CPRA).

Databunker includes built-in features such as data minimization, a consent management platform, an easy-to-use API, audit, and tokenization, reducing the need for custom development.

## Eliminate SQL injections & GraphQL attacks
Databunker’s architecture solves data security challenge for your organization without the need for additional costly solutions.

Acting as an encrypted vault for PII, PHI, PCI, and KYC data, Databunker provides stronger protection than traditional database encryption methods.

## Commercial-friendly licencing & easy integration
Databunker offers a developer-friendly API that simplifies secure data storage and access with minimal effort.

The community edition uses the MIT license, allowing free commercial use.

#### Key Features:
* **Open-Source:** Fully available under the commercially friendly MIT license
* **GDPR Compliant:** Built with privacy regulations in mind
* **Superior Protection:** Goes beyond standard database encryption offered by major vendors

#### How Databunker Reinvents Data Security:
Databunker introduces a new approach to customer data protection:
1. **Secure Indexing:** Utilizes hash-based indexing for all search indexes
1. **No Clear Text Storage:** Ensures all information is encrypted, enhancing overall security
1. **Restricted Bulk Retrieval:** Bulk retrieval is disabled by default, adding an extra layer of defense
1. **API-Based Communication:** Backend interacts with Databunker through API calls, similar to NoSQL solutions
1. **Record Token:** Databunker creates a secured version of your data object - an object UUID token that is safe to use in your database

Don't let your sensitive data become the next breach headline
