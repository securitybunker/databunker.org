⚠️ The reality: <b>traditional database encryption solutions often provides a false sense of security</b>.

Risks of Traditional Database Security Solutions

* **Encryption alone isn’t enough:** Most cloud and security providers only offer basic data or disk encryption
* **Vulnerable GraphQL Queries:** Attackers can access unencrypted data through improperly filtered queries
* **SQL Injection Attacks:** Cybercriminals can easily retrieve plaintext data using SQL injections

#### Introducing Databunker

Databunker is a purpose-built solution for secure storage, data tokenization, and consent management, designed to safeguard:
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* Protected Health Information (PHI)
* Payment Card Industry (PCI) data
* Know Your Customer (KYC) records

## Simplified Compliance Without Custom Development
Deploying Databunker in your organization streamlines compliance, covering most security requirements and certification questionnaires (e.g., SOC2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, CPRA).

With built-in features such as data minimization, consent management, audit capabilities, and tokenization, Databunker reduces the need for custom code.

## Defence agains SQL injections & GraphQL attacks
Databunker’s architecture addresses these security challenges without the need for additional, costly solutions.

As an encrypted vault for PII, PHI, PCI, and KYC data, it provides stronger protection than traditional database encryption methods alone.

## Developer-friendly licencing & easy integration
Databunker offers a simple, developer-friendly API that enables secure data storage and access with minimal effort.

The community edition is available under the MIT license, allowing free commercial use.

#### Extra Features:
* **GDPR Compliant:** Designed to meet modern privacy regulations.
* **Open-Source:** Released under the commercially friendly MIT license
* **Superior Protection:** Goes beyond standard database encryption offered by major vendors

#### How Databunker Enhances Data Security:
Databunker offers a practical approach to securing sensitive data:
1. **Secure Indexing:** Uses hash-based indexing for all searche requests
1. **No Clear Text Storage:** Ensures all information is encrypted, enhancing overall security
1. **Restricted Bulk Retrieval:** Bulk retrieval is disabled by default, adding an extra layer of defense
1. **API-Based Communication:** Your backend interacts with Databunker through API calls, similar to NoSQL database
1. **Record Token:** Generates secure UUID tokens for data objects, which can be safely stored in your application database

Don’t risk your sensitive data—protect it with Databunker.
