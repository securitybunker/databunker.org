If you intend to integrate Databunker with your existing project, you'll need to save customer personal records in Databunker. You can use user token, user email, user login, phone number, or a custom index to look for user details stored in Databunker.

#### Converting a sample project

Take a look at the following database schema. Instead of storing user records in the ``users`` table, they will be securely stored in Databunker.

#### Method 1: simple database reorganization

You will only need to modify the ``users`` table. Remove all personal data from this table, keeping just the original ``userid``/``id`` column, and add a ``usertoken`` column. The ``usertoken`` will link to the user UUID token generated by Databunker.

This method works well if your ``userid`` column is used in many tables and you have a huge database.

A disadvantage of this method is that each user will have two identities: one ``userid`` and one ``usertoken``.

#### Method 2: full database reorganization
You will have to modify all tables that use the ``userid`` column and use ``usertoken`` column instead. The ``usertoken`` will point to the user UUID token generated by Databunker.

This method will require more changes on your database level and in your application code.
