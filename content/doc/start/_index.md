## Step 1. Starting Databunker in demo mode
The easiest way to get started with **Databunker** is to run it as a **Docker container**:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --rm --name databunker securitybunker/databunker demo
```

This command starts a local container with a `DEMO` root access key. It can be used for **testing** and **development**. For a production installation, follow this [installation guide](https://databunker.org/doc/install/).

#### Connecting to Databunker

You can interact with Databunker using:

- [Web Console](https://demo.databunker.org/) listening on port `3000`: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- [REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11310294/Szmcbz32) listening on port `3000`: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Step 2. Useful Databunker commands

### Create a user record

```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/v1/user -X POST -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first":"John","last":"Doe","login":"john","phone":"4444","email":"user@gmail.com"}'
```

### Fetch user records by email

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/email/user@gmail.com
```

### Fetch user records by login

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/login/john
```

### Other commands:

For a full list of commands, see the [API document](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11310294/Szmcbz32).

## Step 4. Convert existing project to use Databunker

If you intend to integrate Databunker into your existing project, you'll need to transfer customer personal records to Databunker and utilize user tokens in UUID format in your primary database when referencing user records.

#### Converting sample project

In the following example, we'll convert database schema to use user records stored in Databunker.

![Original schema](/img/db-original.png)


#### Method 1: simple database reorganization

Using this method will require you to modify only the table of ``users``. You will need to remove all personal data columns from the ``users`` table and leave it only with original ``userid``/``id`` and add ``usertoken``. The ``usertoken``' column will point to the user UUID record generated by Databunker.

![Simple method](/img/db-simple.png)

**Advantages of this method**

This method is suitable if you have a ``userid`` column linked from many tables or you have a very large database. Running the "``alter table``" command can take a lot of time to update your database structure.

**Disadvantages of this method**

One drawback here is that each user now has two identities. One ``userid`` and another ``usertoken``.

#### Method 2: full database reorganization
You will have to go all over tables that have ``userid`` and add ``usertoken`` column instead. The ``usertoken`` is user identity in UUID format generated by Databunker.

![Full reorganization](/img/db-complex.png)

This method will require more changes on your database level and in your application code.
