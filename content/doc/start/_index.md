## Step 1. Starting Databunker for local testing
The easiest way to get started with Databunker is to run it as a Docker container:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --rm --name databunker securitybunker/databunker demo
```

This command starts a local container with a `DEMO` root access key. It can be used for local testing and development.

#### Connecting to Databunker

You can interact with Databunker using:

- [Web Console](https://demo.databunker.org/) listening on port `3000`: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- [REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11310294/Szmcbz32) listening on port `3000`: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### Additional installation options

## Step 2. Useful Databunker commands

### Create a user record

```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/v1/user -X POST -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first":"John","last":"Doe","login":"john","phone":"4444","email":"user@gmail.com"}'
```

### Fetch user records by email

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/email/user@gmail.com
```

### Fetch user records by login

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/login/john
```

## Step 4. Convert existing project to use Databunker

If you intend to integrate Databunker with your existing project, you'll need to save customer personal records in Databunker. You can use user token, user email, user login, phone number, or a custom index to look for user details stored in Databunker.

#### Converting a sample project

Take a look at the following database schema. Instead of storing user records in the ``users`` table, they will be securely stored in Databunker.

#### Method 1: simple database reorganization

You will only need to modify the ``users`` table. Remove all personal data from this table, keeping just the original ``userid``/``id`` column, and add a ``usertoken`` column. The ``usertoken`` will link to the user UUID token generated by Databunker.

This method works well if your ``userid`` column is used in many tables and you have a huge database.

A disadvantage of this method is that each user will have two identities: one ``userid`` and one ``usertoken``.

&nbsp;

#### Method 2: full database reorganization
You will have to modify all tables that use the ``userid`` column and use ``usertoken`` column instead. The ``usertoken`` will point to the user UUID token generated by Databunker.

This method will require more changes on your database level and in your application code.
