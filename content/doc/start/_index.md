## Product brief

Databunker is a special secure storage system designed to store and protect **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, **Protected Health Information (PHI)**, and **KYC** records. It was built to prevent sensitive data exposure through **SQL injection** and **unfiltered GraphQL queries**, offering superior protection compared to standard database encryption provided by Database or Cloud vendors. Additionally, the product is fully compliant with GDPR regulations.

### The hidden risks of traditional database encryption

From security perspective conventional database encryption often provides only a **false sense of security**. Data is usually encrypted solely at the storage or disk level. In the event of **SQL injection** or **incorrectly filtered GraphQL queries**, malicious actors can effortlessly access your data in plain text.

### Solution with Databunker
Databunker offers a paradigm shift in customer data protection:
1. By default, bulk retrieval of user records is disabled, providing an additional layer of defense against potential breaches.
2. Your backend communicates with Databunker through API calls, akin to NoSQL database practices, rather than relying on traditional SQL queries.
3. To access user records, partial user information such as an email address coupled with an access token is required. Additionally, users can be looked up by their phone number, login name, or unique user ID (UUID token).
4. Secure hash-based indexing is utilized for all search indexes by default, further fortifying data protection measures.
5. Databunker ensures that no information is stored in clear text, enhancing overall security.

## 1. Databunker: Quick installation method
The easiest way to get started with **Databunker** is to run it as a **Docker container**:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --rm --name databunker securitybunker/databunker demo
```

This command starts a local container with a `DEMO` root access key. It can be used for **testing** and **development**. For a production installation, follow this [installation guide](https://databunker.org/doc/install/).

#### Connecting to Databunker

You can interact with Databunker using:

- [Web Console](https://demo.databunker.org/) listening on port `3000`: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- [REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11310294/Szmcbz32) listening on port `3000`: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

  -d '{"first":"John","last":"Doe","login":"john","phone":"4444","email":"user@gmail.com"}'
```

### Fetch user records by email

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/email/user@gmail.com
```

### Fetch user records by login

## 4. Convert existing project to use Databunker

If you intend to integrate Databunker into your existing project, you'll need to transfer customer personal records to Databunker and utilize user tokens in UUID format in your primary database when referencing user records.

#### Converting sample project

In the following example, we'll convert database schema to use user records stored in Databunker.

![Original schema](/img/db-original.png)


#### Method 1: simple database reorganization

Using this method will require you to modify only the table of ``users``. You will need to remove all personal data columns from the ``users`` table and leave it only with original ``userid``/``id`` and add ``usertoken``. The ``usertoken``' column will point to the user UUID record generated by Databunker.

![Simple method](/img/db-simple.png)

**Advantages of this method**

This method is suitable if you have a ``userid`` column linked from many tables or you have a very large database. Running the "``alter table``" command can take a lot of time to update your database structure.

**Disadvantages of this method**

One drawback here is that each user now has two identities. One ``userid`` and another ``usertoken``.

#### Method 2: full database reorganization
You will have to go all over tables that have ``userid`` and add ``usertoken`` column instead. The ``usertoken`` is user identity in UUID format generated by Databunker.

![Full reorganization](/img/db-complex.png)

This method will require more changes on your database level and in your application code.
