## Databunker Overview
Databunker is a specialized system for secure storage, data tokenization, and consent management, designed to protect PII, PHI, PCI, and KYC records.

[>> Why choose Databunker? What are the risks of traditional database security solutions?](/doc/introduction/)


## Step 1: Starting the Databunker container
The easiest way to start using Databunker is by running it as a Docker container. Use the following command to launch Databunker with a ``DEMO`` root access key for local testing and development:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --rm --name databunker securitybunker/databunker demo
```

After the container is running, you can interact with Databunker through:

- [Web Console](https://demo.databunker.org/): Available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- [REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11310294/Szmcbz32): Accessible at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [full installation guide](/doc/install/).

## Step 2: Creating a User Record

Databunker's API allows you to create a user record and returns a user token in UUID format.

GDPR Relevance:
* Under **GDPR**, this **user token** is referred to as a **pseudonymized identity**. This token can be safely stored in your regular database or logs, as long as **no** additional personal information is stored with it.
* **Pseudonymization** reduces the risk of directly associating personal data with an individual, reinforcing data protection and privacy principles.
* For example, when receiving a **Right to be forgotten (RTBF) request**, you can delete personal data from Databunker only.

Use the following command to create the user record:

```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/v1/user \
  -X POST -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first":"John","last":"Doe","login":"john","phone":"4444","email":"user@gmail.com"}'
```

Output:
```
{"status":"ok","token":"eeb04dd7-ecb2-c957-2875-5b98897b21a6"}
```

## Step 3: Retrieving user record

You can retrieve user records using indexed fields, such as **email address**, **login name**, **user token**, etc.

**Fetch customer records using user token:**

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/token/eeb04dd7-ecb2-c957-2875-5b98897b21a6
```

You can integrate Databunker into the application's sign-in logic and search for customer records using email address or login name:

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/email/user@gmail.com
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/login/john
```

For a full list of available commands, please check the [API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11310294/Szmcbz32).

## Step 4: Accessing the Web UI

Databunker includes a built-in web UI available at <a href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_blank">localhost:3000</a>.

#### Admin access:

The **admin user** or **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** can use the web interface to:
1. Delete user records to comply with GDPR RTBF "forget me" requests 
1. Manage consent permissions, ensuring proper consent management for GDPR compliance
1. View audit logs, demonstrating compliance with GDPRâ€™s accountability principle

You can use the ``DEMO`` **root token** to get access to the admin panel.

#### End-User Access:

Databunker provides an optional customer portal, allowing end users (or data subject in terms of GDPR) to access and manage their personal information. This feature helps with GDPR compliance, particularly concerning data subject rights.

Key Features:
1. Secure login. End users can log in using their email address or phone number. Databunker generates a random password and sends it to the user via email or SMS to verify their identity.
1. Data view and modifications. Users can view, review, and request modifications to their personal data.
1. View audit events and request account deletion.

GDPR Relevance:
1. **Right of Access (Article 15):** Users can directly access their personal data stored in Databunker.This self-service portal streamlines the process of fulfilling access requests.
1. **Right to Rectification (Article 16):** Users can submit requests for corrections, supporting the right to rectification.
1. **Transparency principle (Article 12):** By providing clear, direct access to personal data, Databunker enhances transparency in data processing.
1. **Right to Data Portability (Article 20):** Users can download their data in a machine-readable format.
1. **Consent Management:** The portal can be used to display current consent status and allow users to modify their consent preferences.

**How to test:**

If you created a sample user with the phone number ``4444``, as shown in the previous example, you can use ``4444`` as both the phone number and password to access the customer portal.

2. Node.js Example with Passport.js, Magic.Link, and Databunker: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/securitybunker/databunker-nodejs-example)

3. Secure Session Storage for Node.js Apps: [Detailed Guide](https://databunker.org/use-case/secure-session-storage/#databunker-support-for-nodejs)

#### Node.js modules

1. `@databunker/store` from https://github.com/securitybunker/databunker-store

2. `@databunker/session-store` from https://github.com/securitybunker/databunker-session-store

## Step 6: Convert existing project to use Databunker

If you intend to integrate Databunker with your existing project, you'll need to save customer personal records in Databunker. You can use user token, user email, user login, phone number, or a custom index to look for user details stored in Databunker.

#### Converting a sample project

Take a look at the following database schema. Instead of storing user records in the ``users`` table, they will be securely stored in Databunker.

![Original schema](/img/db-original.png)


#### Method 1: simple database reorganization

You will only need to modify the ``users`` table. Remove all personal data from this table, keeping just the original ``userid``/``id`` column, and add a ``usertoken`` column. The ``usertoken`` will link to the user UUID token generated by Databunker.

This method works well if your ``userid`` column is used in many tables and you have a huge database.

A disadvantage of this method is that each user will have two identities: one ``userid`` and one ``usertoken``.

![Simple method](/img/db-simple.png)

#### Method 2: full database reorganization
You will have to modify all tables that use the ``userid`` column and use ``usertoken`` column instead. The ``usertoken`` will point to the user UUID token generated by Databunker.

This method will require more changes on your database level and in your application code.
