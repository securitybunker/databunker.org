## Databunker intro

With the rise in personal data leaks, we've developed Databunkerâ€”a solution aimed at safeguarding customer privacy. It's a secure storage system designed specifically to protect **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**, **Protected Health Information (PHI)**, and **KYC** records. Databunker was engineered to prevent sensitive data exposure through **SQL injection** and **unfiltered GraphQL queries**, offering superior protection compared to standard database encryption provided by Database or Cloud vendors. Additionally, our product is fully compliant with GDPR regulations.

### Database Encryption Reality
Let's face it, conventional database encryption often provides only a **false sense of security**. Data is usually encrypted solely at the storage or disk level. In the event of **SQL injection** or **incorrectly filtered GraphQL queries**, malicious actors can effortlessly access your data in plain text.

### Solution with Databunker
Databunker offers a paradigm shift in customer data protection:
1. By default, bulk retrieval of user records is disabled, providing an additional layer of defense against potential breaches.
2. Your backend communicates with Databunker through API calls, akin to NoSQL database practices, rather than relying on traditional SQL queries.
3. To access user records, partial user information such as an email address coupled with an access token is required. Additionally, users can be looked up by their phone number, login name, or unique user ID (UUID token).
4. Secure hash-based indexing is utilized for all search indexes by default, further fortifying data protection measures.
5. Databunker ensures that no information is stored in clear text, enhancing overall security.

## 1. Running Databunker container
The easiest way to get started with **Databunker** is to run it as a **Docker container**:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d --rm --name dbunker securitybunker/databunker demo
```

This command starts a local container with a `DEMO` root access key. It can be used for **testing** and **development**. For a production installation, follow this [installation guide](https://databunker.org/doc/install/).

#### Connecting to Databunker

You can interact with Databunker using:

- [Web Console](https://demo.databunker.org/) listening on port `3000`: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- [REST API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11310294/Szmcbz32) listening on port `3000`: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## 2. Move your user records to Databunker

If you want to use **Databunker** in your existing project you need to move customer data to Databunker and adapt your database schema to use ``usertoken`` (using UUID format).

#### Original database schema

In this example, we'll convert the following database schema to use user records stored in Databunker.

![Ogiginal schema](/img/db-original.png)


#### Method 1: simple database reorganization

Using this method will require you to modify only the table of ``users``. You will need to remove all personal data columns from the ``users`` table and leave it only with original ``userid``/``id`` and add ``usertoken``. The ``usertoken``' column will point to the user record UUID generated by Databunker.

![Simple method](/img/db-simple.png)

**Advantages of this method**

This method is suitable if you have a ``userid`` column linked from many tables or you have a very large database. Running the "``alter table``" command can take a lot of time to update your database structure.

**Disadvantages of this method**

One drawback here is that each user now has two identities. One ``userid`` and another ``usertoken``.

#### Method 2: full database reorganization
You will have to go all over tables that have ``userid`` and add ``usertoken`` column instead. The ``usertoken`` is user identity in UUID format generated by Databunker.

This method will require more changes on your database level and in your application code.


## 3. Some usefull Databunker commands

### Create a user record

```
curl -s http://localhost:3000/v1/user -X POST -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"first":"John","last":"Doe","login":"john","phone":"4444","email":"user@gmail.com"}'
```

### Fetch user records by email

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/email/user@gmail.com
```

### Fetch user records by login

```
curl -s -H "X-Bunker-Token: DEMO" -X GET http://localhost:3000/v1/user/login/john
```
