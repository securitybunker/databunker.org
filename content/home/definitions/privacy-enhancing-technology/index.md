According to "[The GDPR made simple(r) for SMEs](/files/gdpr-for-sme.pdf)" book, published in 2021:

>To comply with **Data Protection by Design (DPbD)** and **Data Protection by Default (DPbDf)**, a company may consider implementing **Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)**.

>PETs encompass a wide range of solutions, incorporating both traditional data security technologies (e.g. anonymization, encryption cryptography, for personal data both being stored or moved) and other tools aimed at a more general strengthening of data protection: for example, antitracking tools for web browsing, dashboards and other user interfaces for the management of consent can be considered, as well as tools that enable data subjects to audit the enforcement of the data protection policy of a controller or to customize the terms and conditions of privacy policies.

**Databunker** stands most requirements for **Privacy Enhancing Technology**. **Databunker** can serve as a cornerstone for your privacy by design compliance.
