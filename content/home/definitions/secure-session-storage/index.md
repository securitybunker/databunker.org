When creating web applications sometimes you need to save data in a session object. This data can include user email address, user permissions, last operation code, error messages. A **session** can be defined as server-side storage of information that is desired to persist throughout the userâ€™s interaction with the website or web application.

Some of the information stored in the **session** is considered personal data or **Personally Identifiable Information**.

GDPR stands on a number of principles. **Integrity and confidentiality** are some of them. These principles tell that **appropriate security measures** should be in place to protect personal data.

Databunker has an API for secure storage on **session objects** inside Databunker's encrypted store. Node.js modules and examples provided:
