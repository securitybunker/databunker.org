According to **GDPR Article 32**:
>The controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk including the **pseudonymization** and **encryption** of personal data.

GDPR defines pseudonymization as:
>‘pseudonymization’ means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept **separately** and is subject to technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.

Databunker meets the pseudonymization definition. User personal data is encrypted and stored separately from the application database.

When saving a user object in Databunker you get a **random user token**. This user token is a **pseudonymized user identity**.

So, now when performing a **cross-border transfer** or **saving application logs**, replace user identity (email, name, etc...) with the **user token** generated by Databunker.

This ensures that the user is **not directly identifiable**. This method is [**compatible with Schrems II**](https://databunker.org/use-case/schrems-ii-compliance/).
