The world of cybersecurity follows the principle of **least privilege**, where user or application processes are granted minimal privileges to perform their tasks. Similarly, in GDPR compliance, we encounter a similar concept known as **data minimization**. This principle emphasizes the importance of keeping customer data to the bare minimum required to provide a service.

If your company serves European customers, GDPR compliance is non-negotiable, irrespective of your location. 

**Data minimization** is a fundamental aspect of GDPR, aiming to protect user privacy and reduce unnecessary data exposure. Companies are obligated to retain only the essential information necessary for providing their services. This ensures that user data is not stored or processed beyond what's required, promoting better data security and privacy practices.

Databunker offers automatic data minimization capabilities, allowing companies to effortlessly comply with GDPR's requirements. Databunker allows you to create data retention policies that ensure that personal records of expired trial users or users who leave the service are removed when they are no longer needed.

By implementing automatic data minimization with Databunker, companies can bolster their data protection efforts. Reducing data exposure not only reduces the risk of data breaches but also enhances trust with customers. With the burden of data management lifted, organizations can focus on providing excellent services while staying GDPR compliant.
