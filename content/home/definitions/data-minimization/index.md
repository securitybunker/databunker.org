In cybersecurity, we have the principle of **least privilege**. It means your user or application process must have minimal privileges to do its job.

In GDPR compliance, we have a similar principle. It is called **data minimization**. You need to keep customer data at a minimum only sufficient to provide a service.

One of the results of the Data Minimization definition is that companies must remove personal records for expired trial users or users who left the companyâ€™s service.
