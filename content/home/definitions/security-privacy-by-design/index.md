**Security by design** and **privacy by design** are important for software developers because they help mitigate risks, ensure legal compliance, build user trust, gain a competitive advantage, save costs, fulfill ethical responsibilities, and create adaptable and future-proof software solutions.

**Databunker** is a special encrypted vault for personal records. This tool can be a foundation for your organization **security by design** and **privacy by design** implementation.

By leveraging Databunker, developers can bolster data security, protect privacy, and demonstrate a commitment to safeguarding sensitive information, thus enhancing their overall security and privacy posture.

In case you built a web app on top of Databunker and you have an SQL injection - customer personal data remains safe within Databunker, isolated from the main database. This isolation prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information, safeguarding user privacy.
