Databunker can help with GDPR compliance in the following ways:
1. Secure Storage: Databunker acts as a powerful encrypted vault, allowing organizations to securely store personal data, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which is a key aspect of GDPR compliance. By encrypting and securely storing user data, Databunker helps protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
1. User Interface for Data Access and Modification: Databunker includes a user interface that enables customers to access and review their personal data. This feature aligns with GDPR requirements, as it allows individuals to exercise their rights, such as the right to access their data and request modifications if necessary.
1. Forget-Me Operation: Databunker offers a forget-me operation, which allows users to request the deletion of their personal data. This functionality supports GDPR's right to erasure (or right to be forgotten), enabling individuals to have their data permanently removed from the system.
1. Audit Events and Notifications: Databunker generates audit events and notifications, ensuring transparency and accountability in data processing. These features help organizations demonstrate compliance with GDPR's accountability principle by maintaining a record of activities related to personal data.
1. Privacy by Design Principles: Databunker is designed with privacy by design principles in mind. By incorporating privacy features and safeguards from the ground up, Databunker helps organizations build privacy considerations into their systems and processes, which is a core requirement of GDPR compliance.
1. Data Security and Protection: Databunker's encryption measures, secure hashing, and access controls contribute to data security and protection. By implementing these security measures, Databunker helps organizations meet GDPR's requirements for data security and protection of personal data.
