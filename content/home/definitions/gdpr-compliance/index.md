Databunker can accelerate GDPR compliance in the following ways:
1. Secure Data Storage: Databunker acts as a powerful encrypted vault specifically designed to protect sensitive records, including Personally Identifiable Information (PII). By securely storing and encrypting personal data, Databunker helps companies meet GDPR's data security requirements.
1. Pseudonymization: Databunker employs pseudonymization techniques by generating random user tokens. By replacing direct user identities (such as email or name) with these tokens, Databunker ensures that personal data cannot be directly attributed to an identified or identifiable individual. This aligns with GDPR's recommendation for pseudonymizing personal data.
1. User Rights Management: Databunker provides a user interface that allows individuals to access and review their personal data, as well as request modifications or initiate the deletion of their data. This feature supports companies in fulfilling their obligations related to GDPR's individual rights, such as the right to access, rectification, and erasure.
1. Forget-Me Operation: Databunker offers a forget-me operation, which allows users to request the deletion of their personal data. This functionality supports GDPR's right to erasure (or right to be forgotten), enabling individuals to have their data permanently removed from the system.
1. Audit Events and Notifications: Databunker generates audit events and notifications, ensuring transparency and accountability in data processing. These features help organizations demonstrate compliance with GDPR's accountability principle by maintaining a record of activities related to personal data.
1. Privacy by Design Principles: Databunker is designed with privacy by design principles in mind. By incorporating privacy features and safeguards from the ground up, Databunker helps organizations build privacy considerations into their systems and processes, which is a core requirement of GDPR compliance.
1. Data Security and Protection: Databunker's encryption measures, secure hashing, and access controls contribute to data security and protection. By implementing these security measures, Databunker helps organizations meet GDPR's requirements for data security and protection of personal data.
1. Compliance Reporting: Databunker can assist in compliance reporting, such as generating reports or facilitating the collection of evidence. These features can help streamline the process of demonstrating compliance with GDPR requirements.
1. Technical and Organizational Measures: Databunker's technical and organizational measures, such as access controls, audit trails, and encryption, contribute to meeting GDPR's requirements for implementing appropriate security measures to protect personal data.
