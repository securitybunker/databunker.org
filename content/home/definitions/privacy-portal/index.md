Upon the creation of a user record, Databunker knows to extract user email, phone number, login, and build a secure search index.

With Databunker, you can provide your customers with **passwordless access** to the **Databunker user privacy portal**. Upon login attempt, the product sends your customer a one-time access code. This code is sent by SMS or email.

Databunker gives the user temporary access to view his data, initiate personal information change request (**data rectification request**), start the forget-me operation, manage privacy agreements, or view audit events.

Upon any user action (depending on configuration), Databunker sends a notification email to the **Data Privacy Officer (DPO)**.

DPO can use Databunker to approve or reject user requests. For example, DPO can approve user forget-me requests.
